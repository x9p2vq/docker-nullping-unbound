The runtime directory is built at container startup.  The build process only copies files that are newer (container file datetime > runtime file datetime) to the runtime directory.  If you modify a file in the runtime directory and restart the container, it will not be replaced.  To reset the container configuration to its original state, stop the container, delete the runtime directory, and start the container.
